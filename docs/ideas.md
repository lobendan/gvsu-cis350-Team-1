 # IDEAS

 # APIs
__Binance API__
 - their Rest APi updates slowly - not fitting for getting live data
 - API key works though - might be needed for later implementation of auto buying and auto selling
  
__Taapi API__
 - well working free plan (only one request every 15 seconds from Binance)
 - able to get data from multiple indicators from each request
 - accuracy has been tested
 - wide range of ETF/Stocks/Crypto Exchanges for paid version
 - scalability is given with Taapi as well, reasonable price for increased request rate
  
 # other feathers

 - probably have to implement some indicators ourselves 
 - import and export strategies
