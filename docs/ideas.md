 # IDEAS

 # APIs

 - start with crypto (Binance API) free to use 1200 requests a minute
 - for later stocks stuff consider finnhub API (60 request per minute - more complex)
 - look into other APIs (TAAPI.IO)


 # other feathers

 - probably have to implement some indicators ourselves 
 - import and export strategies
