# Introduction

The objective of our project is to build an "Autotrader" that is able to get live data and is a framework to automate different trading strategies.
Using that framework, users are able to automate their own strategies, without needing to sit on their screen to do it. 

In order to create the best and easiest user experience, it is essential to have as much information to as many products as possible. 
Meaning there shouldn't be indicators missing as options to as many different stocks, crypto currencies, forex currenices, ETFs, and so on. 

Another major objective is to do this in a cost efficient way, without having excessive costs of APIs to get the data and instead try to rely as much 
as possible on free APIs or even scrape the data off public websites to get the necessary data. This part of the program should also be flexible so that the user is also able 
to choose APIs which might not be free without having to change too much.

An optional feature would be to also test strategies by using old historical data to test the strategies without having to wait for longer periods of time.

The program is designed to be a accessed using a desktop app as a simple but useful GUI.

REMOVE THE FOLLOWING WHEN FINISHING UP:
(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)
(Also define some loosely defined features of your project using bullet points)

# Anticipated Technologies

Use APIs and/or webscrapers to get the data.
Technologies to create the desktop APP (GUI). 


# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)

# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

# Anticipated Problems

(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)

Remember this is a living document is expected to be changed as you make progress on your project.
