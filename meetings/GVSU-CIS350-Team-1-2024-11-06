Discussion points: 

* Discussed the other strategies, not sure where we are going to go with them, unsure if we are going to use any of the other ones or not
* Talked about the GUI, it is now integrated with the API for the user to be able to input their key and see the live data. 
* Discussed our goals from here, cleaning up the gui, making everything in one window, allow the ability to edit variables for strategies and select different assets

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Update README as well as trello board, any other bits that need to be cleaned up
* Finish up the sprint and finalize our main goals are and which direction we want to go to.
* Maybe main focus is GUI, need to start implementing the other features we were hoping for from the beginning
